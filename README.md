# ISSAT - ISRO Satellite Tracker 
ISSAT is an open-source satellite tracking application that allows users to track the position of ISRO satellites in real-time. This project is built using Python and leverages the N2YO API and ISRO for satellite data and map visualization. ISSAT provides a user-friendly interface for selecting specific ISRO satellites and tracking their position over time.
